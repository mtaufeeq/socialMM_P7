So how it works in a food drive thru lane is that workers wear a mask AND you wear your mask! 😷 they are risking their health &amp; life to be able to work &amp; make a living. The LEAST you can do is wear a mask for the 10 min that you are ordering &amp; getting your food. #wearadamnmask,2020-10-18 13:50:32,1317825394427518981,1034619122104102914,mayraga57712006,"Texas, USA",,,,['wearadamnmask'],0,0,en,Twitter for iPhone,,

"Wearing a mask is not a political statement. However it is: 

- a display of support for science, empathy, and compassion

- an essential public health and safety measure 

- a lifesaver 

Wear a mask.
Wash your hands.
