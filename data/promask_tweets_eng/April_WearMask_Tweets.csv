"With this many people wearing masks, no one looks at you or steps away. It feels totally normal. That is the point. If you feel weird when you #WearAMask because you're the only one, remember that you're also giving others social permission to wear one next time they go out.",2020-04-03 21:19:19,1246185535837618176,150446676,MikalJakubal,"California, or wherever.",,,,['WearAMask'],0,1,en,Twitter for iPhone,1.246184848894521e+18,150446676.0

"@atrupar Facts:

- There's no evidence that wearing a mask can help prevent *you* from catching #COVID19 from someone

- There's a lot of evidence that it will help stop *you* from giving it to *them*

- You can be infectious for days before symptoms

"Trump saying he doesn't want to wear a mask completely misses the point. The point of wearing the mask is to protect others from being infected by you, as you may be asymptomatic and still spread the virus. Simple as that. Act as if you have it.  #WearAMask",2020-04-03 21:57:08,1246195053120245760,32812492,shoewizard59,"Arizona, USA",,,,['WearAMask'],1,8,en,Twitter Web App,,
